## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Vite.js](https://vite.dev/) - React framework
- [dnd-kit](https://docs.dndkit.com/) - @dnd-kit – A lightweight, modular, performant, accessible and extensible drag & drop toolkit for React

### What I learned

In this project, I focused on working with TypeScript and refining type definitions. I also wanted to gain experience with a drag-and-drop library. For this purpose, I explored two options: the pragmatic-drag-and-drop library and @dnd-kit. I found @dnd-kit to be more convenient and easier to work with.


### Continued development
In future projects, I would like to focus on using reducers for managing global state. I also aim to deepen my understanding of advanced TypeScript patterns and improve my skills in performance optimization and code organization within React applications.


### Useful resources
